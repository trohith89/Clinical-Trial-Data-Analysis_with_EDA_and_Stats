# Clinical-Trial-Data-Analysis_with_EDA_and_Stats
This project involves data wrangling, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and statistical analysis of Phase 2 clinical trial data for Auralin, a novel oral insulin. Diabetes, a growing epidemic, has been managed with injectable insulin since its discovery. Auralin aims to overcome the stomach lining absorption challenge. 
Evaluate Auralin's efficacy, safety, and comparison to Novodra in reducing HbA1c levels and managing adverse reactions.
By analyzing this data, insights will be gained into Auralin's potential as a groundbreaking oral insulin treatment, addressing the long-standing challenge of stomach lining absorption.
