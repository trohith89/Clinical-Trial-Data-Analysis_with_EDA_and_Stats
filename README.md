# **Problem Statement** : "Can Auralin demonstrate non-inferiority to Novodra in terms of treatment efficacy and safety, based on an analysis of clinical trial data, to justify its potential replacement?"

# **DATA SUMMARY**

This is a dataset about 500 patients of which 350 patients participated in a clinical trial. None of the patients were using Novodra (a popular injectable insulin) or Auralin (the oral insulin being researched) as their primary source of insulin before. All were experiencing elevated HbA1c levels.

All 350 patients were treated with Novodra to establish a baseline HbA1c level and insulin dose. After 4 weeks, which isnâ€™t enough time to capture all the change in HbA1c that can be attributed by the switch to Auralin or Novodra:

*   175 patients switched to Auralin for 24 weeks
*  175 patients continued using Novodra for 24 weeks

Data about patients feeling some adverse effects is also recorded.

# **Additional information:**


*   Insulin resistance varies person to person, which is why both starting median daily dose and ending median daily dose are required, i.e., to calculate change in dose.

*   It is important to test drugs and medical products in the people they are meant to help. People of different age, race, sex, and ethnic group must be included in clinical trials. This diversity is reflected in the patients table.

  
# **Description**:
  1. **Overall Summary** : We are trying to analyze the Clinical Trial Dataset, by performing EDA and Statistical Tests on Data we had already peformed Data Wrangling to clean the given Messy and Dirty Data.

  2. **Table-1 -> Patients** : We have the cleaned table of the Patients table which consists of patients details of over 500 in number, the same patients that are going to act as test subjects for this Clinical Trial Period.

  3. **Table-2 -> Treatments** : We have the cleaned table of the Treatments table which consists of Treatments details being performed on 350 of those 500 patients, where 175 test subjects were given 'Aurilin' and the other 175 were remained on the already ongoing 'Novodra'.

  4. **Table-3 -> Reactions** : We have the cleaned table of the Reactions Table which consists of the adverse reactions that had an effect on the trial patirnts during the ongoing trial period.

  5. We have also merged a few tables/data to have a more precise and elaborate analysis.
