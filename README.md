# Clinical-Trial-Data-Analysis_with_EDA_and_Stats
This project involves data wrangling, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and statistical analysis of Phase 2 clinical trial data for Auralin, a novel oral insulin. Diabetes, a growing epidemic, has been managed with injectable insulin since its discovery. Auralin aims to overcome the stomach lining absorption challenge. 
Evaluate Auralin's efficacy, safety, and comparison to Novodra in reducing HbA1c levels and managing adverse reactions.
By analyzing this data, insights will be gained into Auralin's potential as a groundbreaking oral insulin treatment, addressing the long-standing challenge of stomach lining absorption.
# About the datasets
The increasing prevalence of diabetes in the 21st century is a problem, an epidemic even. Pre 1920s, diabetes was a feared disease, that most certainly led to death. Luckily, in the 1920s, a secretion in the pancreas that lowered blood sugar levels, soon to be called insulin, was discovered by soon to be Nobel Prize winner Frederick Banting.

People with severe diabetes, and only days left to live were saved, but the default method of administration back then was a needle, multiple times a day, and it still is now. This is scary for some people and uncomfortable and inconvenient for the vast majority. The future : Oral insulin. This is an active area of research, and has been for a long time. Historically though there's been a big roadblock, getting insulin through the stomachs thick lining.

In this project, we've got our hands on the phase two clinical trial data for a new innovative oral insulin called auralin. Auralin researchers believe their proprietary capsule will solve this stomach lining problem. Phase two trials test the efficacy and the dose response of a drug, plus identify common short term side effects, also known as adverse reactions. These typically involve several hundred patients.

350 patients participated in this clinical trial. None of the patients were using Novodra (a popular injectable insulin) or Auralin (the oral insulin being researched) as their primary source of insulin before. All were experiencing elevated HbA1c levels.

All 350 patients were treated with Novodra to establish a baseline HbA1c level and insulin dose. After four weeks, which isnâ€™t enough time to capture all the change in HbA1c that can be attributed by the switch to Auralin or Novodra:

175 patients switched to Auralin for 24 weeks
175 patients continued using Novodra for 24 weeks
